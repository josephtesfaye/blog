My rating: 8.1/10

I love it! I was thinking about how the world should be chaotically good recently and what a coincidence this movie came out with the theme conveying this idea! There are lots of WTF moments and genuinely funny scenes. There are also those narrations that really strike a cord with you. We may have been used to it that love is the panacea of all the problems but the story-telling of this movie could still make you shed tears for that. I laughed and cried a lot during watching it.
